# Simplified Perlin Noise

Perlin noise (also sometimes classical Perlin noise) is a mathematical algorithm for generating a procedural texture by a pseudo-random method. It is used in computer graphics to increase the realism or graphical complexity of the surface of geometric objects. It can also be used to generate smoke, fog, etc. effects, *__but in this algoritm we use full random and matrix__*.


# How to use

There are many applications of Perlin noise. I saw a wood texture obtained by using modular arithmetic. I used it to create a path through a roguelike forest. You can easily get clouds by trimming the noise to an arbitrary level. The smoke in Under Construction is Perlin's noise, with the positive values corresponding to smoke and the negative values thrown out.
